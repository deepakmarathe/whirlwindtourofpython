# Variables are pointers 
# x = 4 means x is a pointer to some memory location which holds the value. 
# It is not required to declare the variables with type information or even the type of variable it points to can be different. It is called dynamic typing.

# x is an integer
x = 1
print("x is : ", x)

# x is a string
x = "Hello"
print("x is : ", x)

# x is a list
x = [1,2,3]
print("x is : ", x)

# a & b		bitwise and
# a | b		bitwise or 
# a ^ b		bitwise xor
# a << b	bitwise leftshift
# a >> b 	bitwise rightshift
# ~a		bitwise not

# bitwise operators make sense on binary numbers, obtained by 'bin' method
print "10 in binary : ", bin(10)

# find out the number which combines the bits in 4 and 10.
